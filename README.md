# Out-of-distribution Learning with Gaussian Process Boundaries

## Project Description

We introduce a novel OOD detection method based on Gaussian processes, focusing on establishing a detection boundary using only in-distribution (InD) samples. The core concept revolves around quantifying uncertainty in unconstrained softmax scores through a clustered Gaussian process. By leveraging the posterior predictive distribution from the Gaussian process, we define a score function that effectively distinguishes between InD and OOD samples.
